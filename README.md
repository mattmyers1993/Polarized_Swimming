# How 1 Million Yards of Polarized Training Affected My Swimming
Welcome to my Power BI report on polarized training in swimming. [You can access the report here.](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjAyMDI2ZDYtZGY1OS00MjI3LTlkYTYtMWUzZjk0NzkwMGVmIiwidCI6ImJjMzM5NDJjLTE2YjQtNDcwYS04Yjc5LTk1MmNmMzY0NmJjYiIsImMiOjZ9)

I've been swimming competitively for 25 years. I swam for Johns Hopkins University and more recently have had 2 years ranked in the top ten for 30-35 year olds in the Masters 200 meter butterfly. I'm by no stretch an Olympic swimmer, but I have been training seriously for the last 25 years. 

In August of 2023 I strained my shoulder from overuse. I came across the concept of polarized training and thought it might be an interesting alternative to the hard interval sessions swimmers commonly do day in and day out. 

## The Goal of Swimming Physiology
There are two basic goals with swim training-- to be able to swim faster and for it to cost the body less. Swimming faster is easy enough to measure. If your pace per 25 yard lap in seconds is less, you've gotten faster. To measure if the swimming costs less we can took at heart rate in beats per minute as a measure. If a swimmer can swim the same speed with a lower heart rate, their physiological engine will be able to either swim at that pace for longer or have room to swim faster by exerting more physiological effort. Thus, they can translate this physiological efficiency into faster swimming.

A swimmer's heart rate will tell us something about what energy system they are using. Swimming at lower heart rates predominantly uses the aerobic energy system, meaning producing energy in the presence of oxygen. The higher the heart rate gets, the heart can't pump oxygen to the muscle fast enough, so the muscle produces energy anaerobically or without oxygen. Producing energy anaerobically is fast, but it can't be sustained for long before byproducts build up and is no longer sustainable. 

Most swimming races are in the range of 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Anaerobic energy plays a significant role initially, but the body requires a large proportion of aerobic energy in races longer than even a minute long to sustain speed. If trained properly, the aerobic system can even use the byproducts of the anaerobic system as fuel, making the body a very efficient hybrid engine of sorts. It's important to develop both of these energy systems in training, which is exactly what polarized training aims to do. 



## What is Polarized Training?
Polarized Training is a term popularized by Dr. Stephen Seiler, a physiologist who works with the Norwegian Olympic Federation. The concept is to train a large majority (around 80% of sessions) at low intensity, but for more extensive periods of time. Think a very easy jog or brisk walk where your heart rate stays between 55-65% of max heart rate. Then the other 20% of sessions are devoted to high intensity interval training where the athlete reaches 90-100% of their max heart rate. 

The key hypothesis here is that the low intensity sessions actually do a great job at developing the aerobic system and leave the athlete fresh enough for the interval sessions where they develop the high end of their aerobic system or their anaerobic systems.

Swimming 80% of workouts easy is not a very common approach in swimming outside of some open water and triathlete circles. The aerobic pace for me was slower than my typical warm up or warm down pace. This type of swimming continuously is often dismissed as something newbie lap swimmers do-- "garbage yardage". And I was only going to 1 or 2 of my Masters workouts a week to get my interval training. Could swimming slower really make me faster?  

## Key Questions

So what am I hoping to learn from this data? Anecdotally, I noticed a difference in my endurance. I was definitely holding stronger in the 2nd half of practices than I was before. Previously, I tended to feel strongest as a 100-200 meter swimmer and after doing this training for over a year I felt much more confident signing up for the 400 meter IM and freestyle events. But what was really going on under the hood? Here are the questions I try to answer in this report: 

  1. Did polarized training improve my fitness by making my average heart rate go down when we control for pace?
  2. Did polarized training improve my average pace when we control for heart rate?
  3. While we are digging through this data are there any mechanical efficiencies we can find? i.e. Are there ways that I am swimming that make me faster or more physiologically efficient? 


## How to use this report

To use this report click through the icons under the key findings on the left side of the report. This will change the state of the report to the proper graphs and filter states to look at the relevant findings. Feel free to click on other parts of the graphs or slicers to explore other states (I.E. perhaps you'd like to see the same graphs but for butterfly instead of freestyle or within the context of a specific month). 

When you are done with that finding click on the next Key Finding icon to go to the next set of graphs/filter state. 



## Where does this data come from?

I captured this data using FORM Smart Goggles and a Polar OH1 heart monitor. These goggles collect 26 variables every lap from split time, heart rate, stroke rate, amongst many others. I combined over 200 session files in .CSV format in this report to get an aggregated view of this last year plus of swimming. It's around a million yards worth of data!
